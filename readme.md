### Overview

Long gone are the days when being a rock guitarist meant all you needed was a guitar and an amp.  Today, every rock guitarist goes on stage with approximately 10 different guitar effects pedals.  Each pedal is designed to get the perfect sound for every possible situation.

There are thousands of different pedals for thousands of different sounds. Below is a summary of the most popular pedals and their descriptions.

__Chorus Pedals__ are used to create a full, orchestraic sound. The effect adds multiple layers to your guitar making it sound like 5 or more guitars!

__Compressors__ lower "hard" attacks and boost "low" attacks.  The goal is to make all notes sound at the same volume.  This is essential for consistent and accurate rhythm guitar playing.

__Sustainers__ make the sound of your guitar ring out for as long as you wish.  Sustain is great for screaming treble or rich chord tones.

__Delay and Echo Pedals__ repeat the original sound of a note played on the guitar at a given time interval.  A short delay creates a "Slapback" effect, and a long delay can be used to "open up" a guitar sound by creating an echo effect.

__Distortion and Overdrive Pedals__ simulate the natural breakup from an overdriven amp.  These pedals are essential in Rock, Blues, and Heavy Metal.

__Flangers__ create a deep "whooshing" sound, similar to when a plane takes off from a runway. It is similar to a chorus pedal but creates a much more dramatic effect.

__Fuzz Pedals__ make a guitar sound "fuzzy".  They tend to sound like distortion pedals, but much more distorted.  Fuzz pedals provide higher bass and treble frequences than distortion pedals.

__Loopers and Samplers__ are used to capture a musical phrase and continuously repeat it.  They can be used to layer multiple guitar parts over a looped rhythm track.

__Multi-Effects Pedals__ encompass 2 or more effects into 1 single device.  Usually thousands of different sounds can be created with a single multi-effects pedal.

__Phasers and Shifters__ are used to alter the pitch of a guitar.  They can also be used to "fatten" a guitar sound by providing an additional 1-3 more voices in harmony, such as octaves, 4ths, 5ths, etc.

__Reverb Pedals__ are used to add depth and richness to your guitar tone for both lead guitar and rhyhtm.  They make a guitar sound "grander" by adding some sustain and echo that will simulate playing in either a small room or a large concert hall.

__Tremolo Pedals__ are used to create a pulsing of the volume of your guitar signal.  The effect is similar to quickly raising and lowering the volume of your guitar using your guitar volume knob.

__Vibrato Pedals__ are used to electronically add vibrato to single notes or chords.  A natural vibrato done with the finger can only sharpen a note, but a Vibrato Pedal can repeatedly sharpen and flatten a pitch.

__Wah and Volume Pedals__ are used to boost certain frequencies.  Wah pedals are often used in Hard Rock and Heavy Metal to add some real tone to an otherwise dry guitar sound.


### Chorus

Want to make your guitar sound like a full orchestra?  Well, with a chorus pedal you can!  

A full orchestra is often composed of over 80 musicians  Why is it necessary to have multiple violins?  The answer is that multiple violins playing the same melodic lines create a much richer, fuller, and more musical tone than a single violin playing the same melodic line.

You do not need a full orchestra of guitarists to create the same effect with your instrument.  It can be done electronically, using a chorus effect pedal.  The sound coming from your guitar will sound like the combined sound of multiple guitars.


#### How do Chorus Pedals Work?

The intention of a chorus pedal, is to make one instrument sound like multiple copies of the same instrument.  Whenever there are multiple singers singing in unison, or multiple strings playing the same melodic lines, there is always a slight variation in both time and pitch.  This slight variation in time and pitch is what creates the full orchestraic sound that is rich in tone.  A chorus pedal uses delay to simulate this variation in time and uses modulation to simulate the variation in pitch.

Like many other pedals, including Phasers and Flangers, a Chorus Pedal separates an incoming guitar signals into 2 copies of the same signal.  One of these signals is unaltered, and is referred to as the "dry" signal.  The second signal is altered and is referred to as the "wet" signal.  

The "wet" signal is warbled in and out of tune.  A short delay is also added to the wet signal.  The altered wet signal is then combined with the original dry signal and sent to the amp.  The resulting chorus effect is that your guitar will sound like multiple guitars playing in unison.

#### Rate and Depth Knobs

Pitch and Time are the two charactistics of your guitar signal that a Chorus Pedal alters.  The "Rate" knob controls the time delay, and the "Depth" knob controls the pitch.

__Rate Knob__ - To control the delay that is added to the wet signal, simply adjust the Rate Knob.  Increase the rate to create a more dramatic delayed effect.

__Depth Knob__ - To control the modulation that is added to the wet signal, simply adjust the Depth Knob.  Increase the depth to create a more dramatic modulation effect.

The more that you increase the Rate and Knob, the fuller your guitar will sound.  However, when using a Chorus Pedal, there is always a balance that must be maintained.  You must experiment with the knobs on your own to decide what settings sound the best.


### Compressor & Sustainer

Compressor Pedals smooth out the sound, specifically the dynamics, of your guitar.  This is accomplished by softening the strong attacks and amplifying the weak attacks.

Sustainer Pedals enable you to have the sound of your guitar ring out for as long as you wish, even if the strings stop vibrating.  They achieve the same effect as the right pedal of a piano.

Compressors and Sustainers are similar effects and are generally built into a single pedal.  This means that, with one device, you can add two powerful effects to your arsenal.

#### Compressors in Rhythm Guitar

A Compressor is absolutely crucial for clean and accurate rhythm guitar playing.  Each chord that you play (or "attack") on your guitar is at a slightly different volume.  Some attacks are strong and some attacks weak.  The goal is to to make the dynamics more consistent.  This is when a compressor comes in handy.

For attacks that are too loud, the compressor will slightly decrease the volume.  If the attack is too soft, then the compressor will amplify the volume.  The end result is consistency that is best achieved with a compressor pedal.

#### Sustainers in Lead Guitar

The amount of sustain in a guitar is what separates good guitars from great guitars.  However, even the strings on the best guitar cannot vibrate forever.  Each note you play on the guitar will soon fade out.  What if you do not want the note to fade out so soon?  This is when a Sustain Pedal comes in handy.

A Sustain Pedal will enable you to let any note you play, distorted or otherwise, ring out for as long as you wish.  Sustaining sound is so important that every piano has a sustain pedal built into it.  In a perfect world, every guitar should come with a sustain pedal, but that is not the case.  However, adding a sustain pedal to your arsenal is very easy and affordable.


### Delay & Echo

The delay effects pedal (sometimes referred to as an echo effects pedal) has become a crucial part of every rock guitarists arsenal.  Practically every famous rock musician from 1980 until present day walks onstage with their favorite analog or digital delay pedal tweeked to perfection.

A delay effects pedal, simply put, repeats the original sound of your guitar at a given time interval.  It creates an echo from your guitar.  This echo can be a slow echo, as you would hear in a big cave, or a fast echo that you would hear in a small room. The echo makes your guitar sound "richer" and "fuller".


#### Delay Pedals: Analog vs. Digital

__Analog Delay__: Analog delay pedals sound much "darker" than digital effects pedals.  They create a somewhat "harsher" and "fuller" sound that really makes the "lows" ands "mids" of your guitar ring out.

__Digital Delay__: Digital delay pedals create a much "brighter" sound than analog effects pedals.  For screaming solos in the high register, a digital delay pedal is crucial for making the delayed "highs" created by your pedal sound just as "bright" as your original attack of the note.

__So Which One? Analog or Digital?__ If your guitar sounds "bright", then you need buy a digital delay effects pedal to replicate your sound correctly.  If your guitar sounds "dark", then buying an analog delay effects pedal will work best.   In the end, you must tweek the settings of your pedal to match the sound to your personal prefernce.

#### Using Your Delay Pedal: Selecting Delay Times

Delay times usually range from 30ms (very short) to 600ms (very long).  Most guitarists use delay times ranging from 100-200ms (milliseconds) to replicate the richest sound and tone from their guitar.  However, experimenting with short and long delay times can create that unique sound that you may need for that one special guitar solo.

__Short Delay Times__: 30 to 85ms (milliseconds).  Short delay times are used to create the "Slapback" effect, usually present in Country and Rockabilly tunes.  In Rock, short delay times can be used for an interesting solo that will make your guitar sound like a completely different instrument.

__Long Delay Times__: 200 to 300ms (milliseconds).  Longer delay times make a guitar sound much fuller. When using longer delay times, the guitarist must be careful that the longer repeats do not interfere with other instruments.

Most delay pedals let you change the delay time manually with a knob.  This is a very important when it comes time to buy a delay pedal.


### Distortion & Overdrive

Distortion and Overdrive Pedals are the essence of Rock, Blues and Heavy Metal.  These pedals create the gritty, crunchy sounds that make the electric guitar worth listening to.  

Distortion and Overdrive Pedals define the sounds of almost every classic rock band including Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, and The Rolling Stones.  Blues players use them to add a little raspiness to their tone.  Heavy Metal players crank them up all the way to create a nasty and evil out-of-control sound.

#### Difference between Distortion and Overdrive

__Distortion__ - A distortion pedal makes your guitar sounds very gritty.  It adds a lot of sustain and "crunch" to an otherwise bland guitar tone.  Maximum distortion is used for Heavy Metal sounds, while a little distortion is used to add some character to a standard guitar tone.

__Overdrive__ - An overdrive pedal has a slightly more hollow sound than a distortion pedal.  It sounds like a tube amp cranked to maximum output, adding some "buzz" to your sound.  High overdrive can create fat, throaty sounds, while subtle uses of overdrive are often used to create bluesy sounds.

The difference between these two pedals is very subtle.  The best way to tell the two apart is to experiment!  Listen to each one separately and see which sound you prefer best.

#### How Much Distortion/Overdrive is Best?

Every distortion and overdrive pedal has a knob that enables you to control the amount of distortion/overdrive to add to your tone.  This amount typically ranges from 0 (no distortion) to 10 (maximum distortion)

__Distortion/Overdrive Knob on 0-3__:  Setting the knob anywhere from 0 to 3 will add a little distortion to your tone.  A low distortion/overdrive setting is very useful for blues and rock rhythm guitar.

__Distortion/Overdrive Knob on 3-8__:  Setting the knob anywhere from 3 to 8 is usually the optimum setting for the best tone.  Set it closer to 8 for Rock Lead Guitar for a gritty, cruchy, biting sound.

__Distortion/Overdrive Knob on 9-10__:  This setting is for MAXIMUM DISTORTION and must be used with extreme care.  Often, a setting of 9 or 10 is crucial for a menacing, evil, out-of-control heavy metal sound.  However, careful guitar technique must be used to keep this sound under control.

When using distortion, always use the bridge pickup on your guitar (the pickup that is close to the bridge and furthest away from the neck).  This will add maximum bite to your tone and let the distortion cut through.  The neck pickup is seldom used.


### Flanger

Originally created in 1966, Flanger Pedals are like very much like Phasers Pedals, but with much more attitude.  They enable you the create a cycling "whooshing" sound similar to the sound created by the engine of a flying jet airplane.  The flanging effect is very pronounced and more dramatic than a Phaser Pedal.

In terms of raw power and ability, Flanger Pedals are one of the most impressive pedals on the market.  The gut wrenching sonic effects that they create remain unparalleled and must be heard live to be truly appreciated.

In 1966, the Beatles famous album "Revolver" had every recorded song feature a flanger pedal.  In fact, it was John Lennon of the Beatles that named the popular effect "Flanging".  To this day, flangers remain a popular tool for rock guitarists with an interest in some powerful harmonic-splicing cabilities.

#### How do Flanger Pedals Work?

A flanger splits a guitar signal into 2 separate signals.  The original signal is called the "dry" signal, and the signal that is going to be altered is called the "wet" signal.  The dry signal remains unaltered.  The wet signal is changed by shifting it out of phase from the dry signal by an amount anywhere from 0 to 360 degrees.

Now here is the important difference of Flanger Pedals and Phaser Pedals.  For Flanger Pedals, the wet signal is fed back to itself multiple times (Which can be controlled with the "feedback" knob on the pedal).  That means the out-of-phase signal is continously shifted in and out of phase, which is what makes Flanger Pedals sound much more powerful than Phaser Pedals.

To achieve the spacey powerful effect, the dry and wet signals are combined and sent to the guitar amp.  What we hear out of the amp is the combined in-phase and out-of-phase relationship of the combined dry and wet signals.
This creates a dizzying, supernatural sound that is sure to impress listeners and call attention straight to your guitar.

#### Controlling Flanger Speed

Flangers have a built-in oscillator that continously shifts the out-of-phase signal while keeping the in-phase signal untouched.  Alteraing the rate at which the oscillator oscillates is very useful in creating unique sounds.

Flanger Pedals generally have a knob labeled as "Speed" or "Rate".  It is this knob that controls the speed of the oscillator.  Increasing the rate at which the oscillator oscillates will increase how fast the repitions of the "whoosh" sound are heard.

Flanger Pedals are many guitarists favorite toys.  The massive harmonic capabilities that it posesses make it a must for any guitar pedal enthusiast.


### Fuzz

Imagine if you could crank your distortion to "40" instead of "10".  That is the sound of fuzz!  It is much rougher than the sound of distortion.

This is why Fuzz is often regarded as the ultimate "Grandaddy" of distortion and overdrive pedals.  Fuzz pedals turn your guitar sound into a gritty, distorted sound that is much more dirty and girthful than anything distortion and overdrive pedals alone could ever produce.

If have already heard the sound of a Fuzz Pedal, chances are that you have already rushed to purchase one.  If the distortion on your amp only goes to "10", and you wish that it would go higher, then you are in desparate need of a fuzz pedal.

A Fuzz Pedal is built using either Germanium Transistors (popular in the 1960's) or Silicon Transistors (popular today).

#### Fuzz Pedals with Germanium Transistors

If you like the sound of 1960's Jimi Hendrix fuzz sound, then you need to find an older fuzz pedal that uses Germanium transistors.  These pedals are best found online at websites such as ebay.

Two great fuzz pedals are the Maestro Fuzz-Tone built in 1963 and Sola Sound Tone Bender from 1965.  Both use simple circuits and employ the germanium transistors that will create the authentic 1960's sound.

If your intention is o sound more like Jimi Hendrix (which is always a good thing) then the Dunlop JH-F1 Jimi Hendrix Fuzz Face is the best choice.

#### Fuzz Pedals with Silicon Transistors

For a more stable and consistent fuzz sound, the fuzz pedals being created today work best due to the use of Silicon transistors.  Silicon transistors that are less noisy and offer a more controlled and reliable fuzz sound.

Great fuzz pedals with Silicon transistors include the MXR M173 Silicon Fuzz Guitar Effects Pedal, which is an easy way to get a great consistent fuzz sound in a simple device, and the Hartman Electronics BC108 Silicon Fuzz Pedal, if you are in need of more knobs to dial in the perfect fuzz tone.


### Looper & Sampler

A Looper Pedal (or a Sampler Pedal as some people like to call it) is used to create several layers of melody and rhythm during a live performance with the use of only one guitar.

The Looper Pedal accomplishes this digitally by simply recording what is played and repeating it.  As the recorded track repeats, you are free to play anything else you wish over the recorded track.  Multiple tracks can be layered to create a full, harmonicly-rich sound.

Loopers are usually used for "one-man bands" when the artist is in need of more layers of instruments.  A typical solo singer/guitarist often has a Looper Pedal as his or her replacement for a full band.

#### Looping a Rhythm Part

The most common use of a Looper Pedal is to loop chords or some sort of rhytmic groove.  At a live performance, a guitarist will turn the Looper Pedal on by stepping on the pedal and starting to play a rhythmic  pattern that will be the foundation of his or her song.  The Looper Pedal will be recording the pattern in real-time as it is being played.

By stepping on the pedal again, the Looper Pedal will continuously repeat the rhythmic pattern.  Now, the guitarist is free to play something new on the guitar with the rhytmic pattern as backup.  The guitarist can add a solo to the rhythmic part or even focus on singing over the rhythm.  Another rhythm part can even be layered on top of the original track.

#### Who needs a Drummer?

There is no true replacement for a live band of four or five musicians.  However, a Looper Pedal can replicate many of the qualities of a band.  We already replaced the rhythm guitarist with our 1st track layer.  Now, we can create some sort of drum percussive drum pattern with our guitar.

A guitar cannot replicate the exact sound of a snare or symbol.  However, it can keep time and create a percussive sound.  This is done by a method called "palm muting".

To palm mute, the strings need to be slightly muted with the right hand by placing the palm on the bridge of the guitar where the strings are connected.  Now, when striking the strings with the pick, the guitar will create a percussive sound.  Create a nice 8th note or 16th note rhytmic figure, one or two bars in length.  Use the Looper Pedal to record it, and layer the track on top of the previously recorded rhythm guitar pattern.

#### Advantages of a Looper Pedal

The advantage of using a Looper Pedal as substitute for a drummer is that a Looper Pedal has perfect time!  No need to worry about a drummer that speeds up the time, slows it down, or makes mistakes on certain parts.  The Looper Pedal will provide consistency that can only be created digitally.

Experiment with a Looper Pedal.  As more and more tracks are layered on top of each other, the sound of a full band is steadily achieved as all the layered tracks weave in and out of each other.  Even in a practice situation, a Looper Pedal usually translates to endless hours of fun and experimentation that help build you musically.


### Multi-effects

Distortion, Delay, Reverb, Wah, Flange, Modulation, Phasing, Compression, Overdrive, Fuzz, Looping, Sampling, Chorus ... the list is practically endless.

Many guitarists have found it impractical to carry a pedal around for each sound effect they want to create.  For exactly this reason, the Multi-Effects Pedal was invented.

A Multi-Effects pedal has ALL of the above effects mentioned, and much more, built into one pedal!  Of course, the pedal will be larger due to the sheer abilities that it posseses.  However, many guitarists find it much more convenient to carry one "Do-Everything" pedal instead of 15 pedals, wires and power supplies.

#### Choosing a Multi-Effects Pedal

There is a perfect Multi-Effects pedal for every guitarist and for every budget.  A Multi-Effects pedal ranges from as low as $50 (the "Digitech RP50) to $1500 (the "TC Electronic G-System").  Each pedal has specific advantages and disadvantages.

The expensive Multi-Effects pedals generally offer a million different sounds and capabilities.  Even at a price tag of $1500, this often turns out to be cheaper than buying 15 separate pedals, wires, batteries and power supplies.

The affordable Multi-Effects pedals are usually more practical than giant guitar rigs because they are simpler to use, they weigh less, are easy to carry around, and most importantly, offer dozens of effects for a much cheaper price.


### Phaser & Shifter

Phasers and Shifters, sometimes called "Phase Shifters", are two different names for the same pedal.  They create a repeating "whooshing" sound similar to the sound of a jet airplane as it flies by.  The "whooshing" sound is created in cycles.  The speed of each cycle is controlled by a rate knob (explained below).  This enables you to control how intense a phasing sound you want to create.

The end result of using a phaser can be anywhere from a subtle "whoosh" to complete your guitar tone, or, a dramatic, cycling jet airplane sonic effect.

#### How do Phasers and Shifters Work?

A phaser splits a guitar signal into 2 separate signals.  The original signal is called the "dry" signal, and the signal that is going to be altered is called the "wet" signal.  The wet signal is shifted out of phase with the dry signal by anywhere from 0 to 360 degrees of the full range of the frequency spectrum.

Next, the dry and wet signals are combined and sent to the guitar amp.  What we hear out of the amp is the combined dry and wet signal.  The in-phase and out-of-phase signals create the characteristic swirling, spacey sound that we now know of as a phased sound.


#### Controlling Phasing Speed

Each Phaser has an oscillator that continually changes the amount (in degrees from 0 to 360) that the wet signal is out of phase with the dry signal.

To control the rate at which the oscillator oscillates, phaser pedals have a knob labeled as "Speed" or "Rate".  This knob changes the speed at which the oscillator moves, enabeling you to control the rate at which the "whoosh" sound is heard.  A faster speed or rate will simply increase how fast the "whoosh" sounds come and go.

The best way to learn how to use a Phaser is to experiment with one on your own.


### Reverb

Ever wonder why grand pianos are far more superior than upright pianos?  REVERB is the answer.  Pianists often spend over $100,000 or more on a single grand piano that will create them the reverb they desire.  In this case, the large size of the grand piano is necessary to create this reverb.

Well guess what?  Guitarists can benefit from using reverb too!  The good news is that it will not cost you $100,000.  It will cost you only $50-$100 to get the same effect!  A reverb pedal will replicate the same reverb created by a grand piano by using the small circuitry in a pedal instead of the massive size of a grand piano.

#### Reverb Pedals: Benefits to Tone

Reverb effects pedals are largely responsible for a rich guitar tone.  They add depth and sustain to an otherwise short and dry sound from a guitar by creating an echo.   A reverb pedal basically replicates the right pedal of a piano, which is used to add sustain to a note or chord.

Singers also use reverb to enhance their reverb.  Adding reverb to your guitar will also make it sound much larger and fuller in the same way.  If playing in a small room with an amplifier, you can add reverb to make your guitar sound as if you are playing in a football stadium or concert hall.  Reverb replicates the natural echo you would receive in such large venues.

#### Using Reverb for Rhythm Guitar

A reverb pedal is cruicial for clean and consistent rhythm guitar playing.  It creates the necessary sustain to smoothly connect one chord to another.  Without a reverb pedal, each chord of a rhythm guitar part will sound disconnected from every other chord, creating a very "choppy" sound.

Your fingers can only move so fast from one chord to another, and a reverb pedal is used to fill in the gaps by creating the necessary echo for a short period of time while you move from one chord to another.

#### Using Reverb for Lead Guitar

The same concepts apply to lead guitar as they do to rhythm guitar when applying reverb.  The echo from the reverb pedal makes every lead guitar solo sound much smoother and fuller.  It will ensure that each note of your solo is fluidly connected to any following note you play.  In short, it will make every note you play on your guitar sound better!

#### How much reverb is best?

For the majority of situations, you need to add a small bit of reverb to your guitar.  Your reverb pedal will have a knob that will let you control the amount of reverb you want to add to your guitar.  Usually, setting this knob anywhere from 10% to 30% will do the trick, depending on your specific tastes.

For some situations, you can set the reverb to more than 30%.  This will truly make your guitar sound "grand" and add character to your sound.  An example of this can be heard in the song "Comfortably Numb" by the famous classic rock band, Pink Floyd.  In this song distortion and reverb are combined to create a powerful and grand guitar tone that screams beautiful tone.


### Tremolo

A Tremolo Pedal creates a pulsing of the volume from your guitar signal.  It simulates turning the volume of your guitar up and down quickly using your volume knob.  The Tremolo sound is often confused with a fast vibrato.  It is important to keep in mind that only the volume is quickly changing, while the pitch remains the same.

Tremolo is responsible for many subtle and sometimes strange guitar tones on recordings.  Many unique guitar sounds are created by slightly changing the controls of a Tremolo Pedal.

#### Using a Tremolo Pedal

Tremolo Pedals usually have two to four knobs available to tweek.  The most common controls are "Intensity", "Speed", "Slope, and "Volume".

__An Intensity Knob__ controls the amount of change to the volume.  For example, let's say your guitar volume, on a scale of 1-10, is on 5.  A low intensity will have your volume change from 4 to 6 repeatedly.  A high intensity can have the guitar volume change from 2 to 8 repeatedly.

__A Speed Knob__ controls how fast the volume is raised and lowered.  From our previous example, let's say that the tremolo is changing your guitar's volume from 4 to 6.  Well, how long is the volume going to stay on 4 and how long is it going to stay on 6?  This is deteremined with the "Speed" knob.  Try setting the speed to the tempo of the song, or twice the tempo of the song.

__A Slope Knob__ is available on some Tremolo Pedals.  It is somewhat of an extension of the "Intensity" knob.  A "Slope Knob" is an added control that determines how sharply the volume changes.  Setting a high slope can create choppy helicopter sounds.  A low slope will yield more fluid volume changes.

__A Volume Knob__ controls the sound of your original guitar signal in relation to the pulsing tremolo signal.  If you want the tremolo effect to fully replace your original guitar sound, set a very low volume knob.  If you want a tremolo effect that is subtle and low in volume, set the volume knob higher so that your original guitar sound rings out.

If you are interested in an affordable pedal with just the basics (Speed and Intensity Knobs) then try the Rocktron Pulse Tremolo Pedal.  If you're interested in total control of your tremolo sound with all 4 knobs available, then the Voodoo Lab Tremolo Pedal is a great choice.


### Vibrato

Natural vibrato is one of the purest and most musical forms of expression available to a guitarist.  For many, it is the reason they play the guitar instead of the piano.  A guitarist creates a vibrato by wiggling the finger against the string when it is played.  This raises the note from natural to sharp and back again.

A Vibrato Pedal simulates a guitarist's natural vibrato.   The important difference is that the note is sharpened, then flattened, and repeated.  A natural vibrato done with the finger can only sharpen a note, while a Vibrato Pedal can both sharpen or flatten a note.

#### Speed and Depth Knobs

__A Speed Knob__ controls how fast the note's pitch is changed.  Setting a high speed setting will simulate wiggling the finger against a note really fast.

__A Depth Knob__ controls how much a note's pitch is altered.  Setting a high depth will create a dramatic vibrato that is often used in hard rock, heavy metal, and sometimes blues.  Set a low depth for a more of subtle vibrato effect.

When choosing a vibrato pedal, make sure that it contains these 2 essential knobs.  Any other controls are just icing on the cake.


#### Using a Vibrato Pedal for Lead Guitar

While playing a solo, a guitarist usually chooses certain notes to add some vibrato to.  These are usually the notes that are longer in duration.  There is simply not enough time to add vibrato to the shorter notes.  It is too physically demanding, and sometimes simply impossible, to add vibrato to every note.  This is especially true if you are playing 16th notes at 160bpm (beats per minute) or faster.

A Vibrato Pedal can electronically accomplish adding vibrato to every note you play.  No matter how fast you are playing your solo, each note will have a little vibrato added for a very interesting effect.

#### Using a Vibrato Pedal in Rhythm Guitar

What if you wanted to play open chords on the guitar with vibrato?  It is impossible to add vibrato to all the notes of a full chord because you only have 4 fingers on the fretboard and there are a total of 6 strings vibrating.

A Vibrato Pedal can be used to add the necessary vibrato to all 6 strings.  Simply preset the "Speed" and "Depth" knobs to a setting that matches your tastes and play any chord.  The pedal will add a vibrato to the full chord.  This will give a standard rhythm part or chord progression much more character and appeal.


### Wah-wah

A Wah-wah Pedal, or Wah Pedal for short, boosts certain frequencies of your guitar signal.  A Wah Pedal alters your guitar tone, creating a unique sound effect that is similar to a human saying "Wahhhh".

Wah Pedals are used to add a human characteristic to guitar tone.  The "Wahhhh" sound it creates is useful for having your guitar boost past the noise of drums, bass, and vocals when necessary.

#### How to Use a Wah Pedal

A Wah Pedal is controlled by rocking your foot back and forth.  Rocking your foot controls a sweeping peaking filter, which basically boosts whichever frequencies of your guitar that you choose.

__Boosting High Frequencies__ - To boost the high frequencies of your guitar, step on the pedal to depress it all the way.  If you already played a note or chord, this will make your guitar scream "Wahhhh"!

__Boosting Low Frequencies__ - To boost the low frequencies of your guitar, put pressure on the pedal with the heel of your foot to rock the pedal back.  This boosts the lowest frequencies of your guitar.

The purpose of a wah pedal is to continuosly rock the pedal back and forth with your foot.  It is rocked forward to create a frequency "swell", for example, at the end of a musical phrase, and rocked back to return to your original tone.  The rocking of the pedal should be rhythmic and coincide with whatever rhythm pattern or solo you are playing.

#### Popular Use of the Wah Pedal

__Jimi Hendrix__ popularized the Wah Pedal in the late 1960s.  Listen to "Voodoo Child" to get an idea of the sound of the Wah Pedal.

__Kirk Hammett__ (Metallica) uses the Wah Pedal on multiple guitar solos.  Listen to the solos in the songs "The End of the Line" from the Death Magnetic album and "No Leaf Clover" from the S&M album to hear the unique, powerful sound created by a Wah Pedal.

__Tom Morello__ (AudioSlave, Rage Against the Machine) uses a Wah Pedal in multiple songs including "Bombtrack", "Guerrilla Radio" and "Bulls on Parade".

__John Frusciante__ (Red Hot Chili Peppers) used a Wah Pedal in the majority of his solos while on tour, including two of the popular songs "Californication" and "Soul to Squeeze".
